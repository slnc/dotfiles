# SCRIPTING
# You can specify a script that gets run when the rule matches by

#   script appname summary body icon urgency
# where urgency can be "LOW", "NORMAL" or "CRITICAL".

# NOTE: if you don't want a notification to be displayed, set the format
# to "".
# NOTE: It might be helpful to run dunst -print in a terminal in order
